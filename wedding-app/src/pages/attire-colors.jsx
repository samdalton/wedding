    <h2>Attire &amp; Dress Code</h2>
    <p>
      We're getting married on ranch on a tropical island overlooking the ocean, so don't expect to be wearing anything too formal! The Bride will be in a light dress, and the Groom, jacketless with a bowtie.
    </p>
    <p>
      The weather will be mostly sunny, temperates in the {copy.ambientTemp}, with a chance of short and mild rain showers. A light layer will be useful as the temperature can drop by 5-10ยบ in the evening as the tradewinds build.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ceremony and cocktail hour will be on grass, and the reception in a barn so simpler footwear is encouraged.
